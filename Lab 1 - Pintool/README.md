This project discusses program analysis using Pintool and writing efficient sorting algorithms. A Pintool was designed to count the number of instructions for various sorting algortihms such as Bubble sort. The number of memory and non-memory instructions were counted as well as the total execution time required to execute the algorithm. Another sorting algorithm was implemented to execute at 25x lower total instructions than Bubble Sort.
